# Twitter-brand-monitoring

This repo is for basic boilerplate Python scripts for Twitter's filtered stream API.

The add_rules_examples.py file is a very basic first draft of rules that can be used to filter tweets for your brand/use case.

Similarly, the get_stream_example.py is the most basic python script for connecting to Twitter's filtered stream API. In the file, there are suggested ways to customize it for your use cases.

Check out Twitter's filtered stream API documentation here: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/introduction and it will link you to their sample code, which is what I am using, here: https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code
